        <p>Our company, 'Sheet's Good', was all started by our main founder John Smith. During college, he had a dream where the sheets weren't scratchy and allowed for amazing sleep all while being eco-friendly and ethically sourced. He dropped out of college to fulfill his dream and now 5 years later, we have finally gotten out of the red and are able to create a website to tell everyone about how our sheets are amazing at Sheet's Good.
